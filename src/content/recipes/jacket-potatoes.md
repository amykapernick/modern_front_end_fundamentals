1. Preheat oven to 180C
2. Wash the potato, but make sure not to scrub the skin off
3. Dry gently with paper towel
4. Pierce with a fork a couple of times
5. Place on a wire rack on a baking tray, to ensure the potato can drain and cook properly on all sides
6. If you're using sweet potato as well, place it in the oven to roast too
7. Bake in the oven for 90mins or until tender inside and crispy outside
8. During the last 20mins of cooking time, take the potatoes out of the oven and rub with olive oil and salt
9. When returning potatoes to the oven, increase to 220C for the remainder of cooking time
10. Cut a hole in the top of your potato, and scoop the insides into a bowl (work quickly before the potato cools).
11. Mash the potato, mixing with the sweet potato if you're using it, and plenty of butter, salt and pepper
12. Add chives, bacon and anything else you want to have with your baked potato, then put the potato back into the skin and put the top on (it won't fit properly anymore, but this is fine)
13. Serve with a sprinkle of cheese and a good spoonful of sour cream
